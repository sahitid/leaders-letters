  Hey! I'm Peter, and I'm a 16-year-old Hack Club leader from Singapore. Here's an interesting story of how I lost my hours of sleep to some teenage shenanigans and started building more Hack Clubs in Singapore.

Hey!

I'm Peter.

(see me standing next to Tom Preston-Werner there? I felt very cool for a second.)

I'm a 16-year-old club leader from Singapore, and I run a Hack Club at Stamford American International School.

When I first walked into high school as a wide-eyed Grade 9 student, I had no idea I'd soon be juggling more lines of code than hours of sleep (_author's note:_ please get 9 hours of sleep - you won't regret it). The SAIS Hack Club, which started as a wild idea between homework sessions and jazz band practice and now with over 40 members, quickly transformed into my passion project, my haven, and sometimes, my chaos.

Against all odds, we thrived. We managed to secure over $2000 in funding, which, if you ask me, felt like an endless supply of pizza (_author's note:_ because let’s be honest, Hack Club runs on boba and pizza). Every week, we hacked away with our projects for one hour, innovating and sometimes breaking things, but always learning and growing (_author's note:_ mostly breaking things). From coding challenges to building mini-games, and even prototyping solutions for real-world problems, our workshops became a sandbox for creativity.

Conducting weekly workshops was my way of giving back. Each week, I taught front-end development, web programming, and other computer science skills to club members and watched as curiosity turned into capability. We dabbled in JavaScript, explored the ins and outs of HTML/CSS, and even took a detour into Python for those keen on data science. I learned that teaching is the best way to learn, and my members constantly surprised me with their creativity and resilience.

But it wasn't just about technical skills. We also delved into discussions on the ethics of AI, the future of blockchain, and how technology can drive social change. By the end of it, it wasn't just about the code; it was about proving that innovation isn't reserved for the "adults."

My role didn't just stop at the school gates. Being part of the global Hack Club community meant I got to extend my influence and connect with brilliant minds from across the globe. The Summit in San Francisco this February was a turning point. Being invited to serve as a panel leader on diversity and inclusion was an honor. It was a room full of energy, ideas, and, most importantly, hope. Hope that young leaders can change the world, one line of code at a time (_author's note:_ and maybe a few memes along the way).

The Hack Club Leaders’ Summit wasn’t just a conference; it was a melting pot of ideas. I shared the stage with incredible minds, discussing challenges like how to make tech more accessible to underrepresented communities. We brainstormed initiatives, shared success stories, and even planned cross-continental collaborations. (P.S. shoutout to Vivian, Brianna, and Keru for being my awesome teammates! I'm building Orpheogotchi as a full-fledged app soon... y'all should be the first to try it!)

Now that you have gotten to know me, let's get started. I have a lot to share about my journey as a Hack Club leader, but I'll start with some of the most important things I've learned:

1. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from leading a Hack Club, it’s that chaos is something to embrace. Innovation often comes from the unexpected, from the moments when things don’t go as planned. Instead of shying away from the messiness of creativity, dive into it. Let those moments of uncertainty fuel your passion to solve problems and think outside the box. After all, sometimes the best ideas come from trying to fix something that broke during a hackathon.

2. Coding isn’t just about making things work; it’s about making things meaningful. Whenever you’re building something, ask yourself why it matters. Is it solving a real problem? Is it helping someone in some way? Purpose-driven projects not only resonate more with others but also keep you motivated when the going gets tough. This is especially important when you're leading others – inspire your team with a shared vision that goes beyond just completing a task.

3. One of the most effective ways to solidify your knowledge is to teach it. When you explain concepts to others, you reinforce your understanding and often gain new insights. Plus, sharing knowledge creates a cycle of learning that benefits everyone involved. Whether it’s through workshops, mentoring, or just informal conversations, make teaching a habit. It’s a powerful way to grow both individually and as a community.

4. Community is what drives real progress. It’s easy to get caught up in the competitive nature of technology, but encouraging a culture of sharing, whether it’s code, ideas, or even just experiences, always leads to stronger ideas and more impactful projects.

5. No matter how much you achieve, there’s always more to learn. Stay curious, and don’t be afraid to admit when you don’t know something. Humility opens doors to new opportunities and connections, as people are more willing to help you grow when you’re honest about your knowledge gaps. Curiosity, on the other hand, keeps you moving forward, exploring new technologies, and challenging your assumptions.

6. While it’s great to be passionate about what you do, remember that burnout is real. You can’t pour from an empty cup. Make time for rest and recharge, even when the temptation is to keep pushing forward. Creativity flourishes when you give your mind space to breathe. Find a balance that allows you to pursue your goals without sacrificing your well-being.

7. Finally, whether you’re leading a club, a team, or just a project, empathy is key. Understand the needs, struggles, and aspirations of those around you. Leadership isn’t just about making decisions; it’s about fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and heard. When people know that you care about them as individuals, they’re more likely to be motivated and committed to the collective vision.

Reflecting on my journey, it’s funny how what started as a small initiative in my school turned into something much bigger. Organizing BuildingBloCS 2024 was another milestone. It was the first time I got to see the impact of my work on a larger scale, as students from across Singapore came together to participate in our AI-themed hackathons. Featuring Dr. He Ruimin, Singapore’s Chief AI Officer, in a fireside chat was surreal, but what truly made it special was seeing students from different schools, different backgrounds, all united by their passion for technology.

The success of BuildingBloCS 2024 wasn’t just a win for me; it was a win for the entire Hack Club community in Singapore. It showed that we could create platforms that inspire and empower young innovators. And yes, seeing three new Hack Clubs sprout up as a result of our efforts was the cherry on top.

So here I am, still a bit wide-eyed but now with a lot more experience and a ton of stories. Leading the SAIS Hack Club has been a rollercoaster, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. To anyone thinking of starting something new, especially if it seems a bit wild – do it. The chaos is worth it, and the creativity it unleashes is unparalleled. (_author's note:_ also, don't forget the snacks. and the music.)
